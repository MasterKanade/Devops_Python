# to import some mathematical in built functions and not all
import math
# Round function can round the number which is nearest to the whole number
print(round(2.9))  # the nearest whole number is 3 therefore, it will print 3
print(round(2.4))  # the nearest whole number is 2 therefore, it will print 2
# It ranges from 0.0 to 0.5 for the lower whole number and 0.6 to 0.9 for the upper.

# The absolute number will return the absolute value of the number even if it is negative
print(abs(-2.9))  # it will print the positive 2.9

# for all the mathematical operations
print(math.ceil(2.2))  # it will print the 3

# for getting factorial number
print(math.factorial(5))  # it will print the factorial of 5 which is : 120
